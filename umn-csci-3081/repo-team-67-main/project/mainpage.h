 * Welcome to our Drone Search and Rescue Project!
 *
 * In this project we used a blob detection filter to process images and then utilized this to search an image for a robot. We also implemented a simulation where we create different entities and implement their various movements. 
 * 
 * Our project does not currently work because we have not implemented the factory, image facade and simulation facade fully. We also lost a team member which resulted in more work being split amongst us.
